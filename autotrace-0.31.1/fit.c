   spline around a corner.)  The general strategy is to look through all
   the points, remembering which we want to consider corners.  Then go
   through that list, producing the curve_list.  This is dictated by the
   fact that PIXEL_LIST does not necessarily start on a corner---it just
   starts at the character's first outline pixel, going left-to-right,
   top-to-bottom.  But we want all our splines to start and end on real
   corners.

   For example, consider the top of a capital `C' (this is in cmss20):
                     x
                     ***********
                  ******************

   PIXEL_LIST will start at the pixel below the `x'.  If we considered
   this pixel a corner, we would wind up matching a very small segment
   from there to the end of the line, probably as a straight line, which
   is certainly not what we want.

   PIXEL_LIST has one element for each closed outline on the character.
   To preserve this information, we return an array of curve_lists, one
   element (which in turn consists of several curves, one between each
   pair of corners) for each element in PIXEL_LIST.  */
